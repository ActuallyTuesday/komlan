            <h2>Outer Space can be Pretty Frightening</h2>
            <p>Outer space is one of the most terrifying and mysterious places known to humankind, perhaps even moreso than the ocean. The vast emptiness stretches endlessly since mose of outer space is just a void yet filled with deadly radiation, black holes that can swallow entire stars, and planets with extreme, inhospitable conditions. One of the scariest things about space is how unforgiving it is because without a protective suit, a human would freeze, suffocate, or be exposed to deadly cosmic rays in an instant. Black holes, with their immense gravitational pull, can trap anything that comes too close, never to be seen again. Space also holds the threat of rogue planets, massive asteroids, and solar ray bursts which are dangerous cosmic events that could wipe out entire civilizations in seconds. And perhaps the most unsettling thought of all is the unknownâ€”what else might be lurking in the endless darkness, waiting to be discovered?</p>
